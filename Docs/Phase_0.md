# Phase 0 – Foundations

This phase sets up the groundwork for development. Key objectives:

1. **CI Pipeline** – lint, format and test on every pull request.
2. **Design Tokens** – merge brand colours and spacing from `design/tokens.json`.
3. **Skeleton App** – ensure the Expo project boots on iOS, Android and Web.
4. **Documentation** – outline coding conventions and repository standards.

Further planning details will be fleshed out in later versions of this document.
