Note: It's recommended to design your icon at the largest size (1024Ã—1024 px (52.0Ã—52.0 mm)) and scale down to the required sizes to maintain quality.

ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices for All Platforms
Design at a Large Size: Start with a 1024Ã—1024 px (52.0Ã—52.0 mm) design and scale down to avoid quality loss.

Simplicity: Use simple, recognizable shapes.

Avoid Small Details: Small text or fine details may not scale well.

Contrast: Design with contrast in mind for both light and dark backgrounds.

Center Content: Keep visual content centered to prevent cropping.
