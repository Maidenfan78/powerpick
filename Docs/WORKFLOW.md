# Workflow & Contributing

This document describes how to work on the project.

- **Branching:** create feature branches off `main` with `feat/`, `fix/` or `chore/` prefixes.
- **Commits:** keep messages concise and follow the style `[feat][fix][chore]: summary`.
- **Pull Requests:** open PRs early, run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run format` before pushing.
- **Reviews:** at least one approval is required before merging.

Additional guidelines will be expanded as the project matures.
