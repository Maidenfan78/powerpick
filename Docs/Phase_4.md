# Phase 4 – Implementation

This phase covers **Implementation Sprints 1‑3**, where the core user flows come to life. Key objectives:

1. **Region Selection** – load real draw data and allow players to choose their preferred lottery.
2. **Number Generation** – produce statistically‑weighted suggestions based on the selected game.
3. **Saving Predictions** – store generated numbers to the user's account with local persistence.
4. **Exit Criteria** – users can select region → generate & save numbers.

Further adjustments may expand on these goals as the project progresses.
